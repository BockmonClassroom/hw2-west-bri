1. Explain your data collection process. 
I used a clear plastic ruler and measured the leaves from stem to tip. I kept track of leaves I had measured and measured a random sampling from
each plant.

2. What instrument did you use to collect data with?
A clear plastic ruler with 1/16" marks

3. Argue the accuracy and precision of your instrument.
The ruler is a tool built to measure linear distance. It measures inches and fractions of inches which are US customary units and matches my other linear
measuring tools (other rulers/tape measures). The precision is 1/16th of a inch. The abnormal shape of the leaves and the admittedly inconsistent measuring
technique I used make the 1/16" precision more than precise enough


4. How many data points did you collect? Why? 
I was able to get 79 total data points. I had 4 plants available (ok I had more, but they don't have leaves) and I just measured around the same amount of leaves
from each plant. 


5. Define the size of your data in terms of both N (full data set size) and n (each subset size).
N: 79
Aloe Vera: 18
Corn Plant: 17
Dwarf Umbrella: 24
Parlor Palm: 20

6. Explain any problems that you ran into during the data collection process.
The first problem was figuring out where leaves began on the Aloe Vera and the Corn Plant.

The second problem was figuring out what angle the ruler should be held at on the leaves. Some of the leaves weren't symmetrical, so determing the widest
part was not precise.

The third problem was some of the leaves on the Corn Plant had "dead ends" and I was not sure if those should count towards the length.
I decided they did not.
